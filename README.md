## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used w3schools mainly to refer to formatting of Javascript syntax.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I defintely did struggle with the random pattern function, overriding the pre-existing condition playClueSequence() but eventually I realized I had to use that to create the random so it took a long time. I kept looking up syntax so I can make sure it wasn't a syntax error and I kept using trial and error between every idea I could think of.

The most time I spent was on trying to incorporate images on the button but after spending 2 hours on it I had to stop because I couldn't figure it out with the time constraint. I wanted the buttons to be animal pictures when active and the audio to me animal sounds. However, I couldn't.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I have questions about implenting images on buttons and why are we not allowed to edit opacity of background images? I had to edit the opacity on a third party website and create a new image to implement that into the wesbite since nothing one the internet was being helpful. I would also want to learn about how web development works in the real world because I am not sure if anyone is out there hard coding websites anymore.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours I would definitely try to finish my animal theme buttons and implement the audio. I also want to work o nthe time clock. Based on my previous experience with Javascript I always found dealing with time to be pretty difficult so i want to do more of that and get better at it. I think that would be pretty cool. I also want to work on the aesthetic of the website. I always get caught in the looks of wesbite when working on them especially when I have been working on functionality for so long, I take a break from it by working on the CSS.
